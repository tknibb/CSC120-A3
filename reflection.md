- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
        I was first stumped by Java because of the different syntax it has compared to python. I would be thinking of how I would complete something but in python so now I have to research all the ways to do it but in Java which is a little more complicated since it is so literal. 

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
        Programming is a learning process that requires many trials and errors that I can't let discourage me. There are many differences between python and Java; the main difference being the syntax. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
        What works for me is working with other people to talk through your ideas since I think multiple brains are better than one. That's also my advice for someone taking this course in the future; do not stress too much since everybody is in the same boat and everyone is willing to help you through an issue.
